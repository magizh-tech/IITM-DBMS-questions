Here are some questions based on the video content:

1. **What is the relational model in databases, and why is it important?**
   - The relational model represents data in tables (relations) with rows and columns. It's important because it ensures data is organized, efficient, and easily queried using relational languages like SQL.

2. **What are attributes in the context of a relational model?**
   - Attributes are the columns in a table, representing characteristics or properties of the data in the table (e.g., name, age).

3. **How do you differentiate between simple, composite, and derived attributes?**
   - Simple attributes cannot be divided (e.g., age), composite attributes can be subdivided (e.g., address), and derived attributes are calculated from other data (e.g., age derived from date of birth).

4. **What is the difference between a schema and an instance in a relational model?**
   - A schema defines the structure of the database (e.g., tables, columns), while an instance is the actual data at a given moment.

5. **Can the schema of a database change, and how?**
   - Yes, the schema can change through operations like adding/removing tables, altering columns, or redefining constraints, though this is less frequent than changes to data instances.

6. **What is a primary key, and why is it important in a relational model?**
   - A primary key is a unique identifier for each row in a table, ensuring no duplicate entries. It is crucial for data integrity.

7. **What are candidate keys and foreign keys?**
   - Candidate keys are possible choices for the primary key, while foreign keys link one table to another, maintaining referential integrity.

8. **What are some examples of relational query languages?**
   - SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most common, but others like Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus are used theoretically.

9. **How does SQL interact with a relational database system?**
   - SQL allows users to create, modify, query, and manage databases through commands like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE`.
