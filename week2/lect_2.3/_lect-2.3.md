Here are questions and answers based on the content of the video:

1. **What is Data Definition Language (DDL)?**
   - DDL consists of commands used to define and modify database structure, such as `CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP` tables.

2. **How do you use the `CREATE TABLE` statement in SQL?**
   - `CREATE TABLE` defines a new table, specifying the column names and their data types (e.g., `CREATE TABLE Employees (ID INT, Name VARCHAR(50))`).

3. **What are integrity constraints in SQL?**
   - Integrity constraints ensure data consistency and correctness, such as `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, and `UNIQUE` constraints.

4. **What is the role of Data Manipulation Language (DML)?**
   - DML is used to manage data within tables, including commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `SELECT`.

5. **What is the structure of a basic `SELECT` query?**
   - A basic `SELECT` query retrieves data from a table using the syntax `SELECT columns FROM table WHERE condition`.

6. **How is the `WHERE` clause used in a query?**
   - The `WHERE` clause filters rows based on a condition, for example, `SELECT * FROM Employees WHERE Age > 30`.

7. **What is the purpose of the `FROM` clause in SQL?**
   - The `FROM` clause specifies the table(s) from which data is retrieved in a query.

8. **What is the difference between the `AND` and `OR` operators in SQL?**
    - The `AND` operator requires both conditions to be true, while the `OR` operator requires at least one condition to be true.

9. **How do you use the `ORDER BY` clause in a query?**
    - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result set based on specified columns, such as `SELECT * FROM Employees ORDER BY Salary DESC`.

10. **What is the purpose of the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL?**
    - The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group rows that have the same values in specified columns, often used with aggregate functions like `SUM` or `COUNT`.

11. **What is the structure of a basic `INSERT` statement in SQL?**
    - The `INSERT` statement adds new rows to a table, specifying the table name and values to be inserted (e.g., `INSERT INTO Employees (Name, Age) VALUES ('Alice', 25)`).

12. **How do you update existing data in a table using SQL?**
    - The `UPDATE` statement modifies existing data in a table, specifying the columns to be updated and the new values based on a condition (e.g., `UPDATE Employees SET Salary = 50000 WHERE ID = 1`).

13. **What is the purpose of the `DELETE` statement in SQL?**
    - The `DELETE` statement removes rows from a table based on a condition, such as `DELETE FROM Employees WHERE Age < 25`.
